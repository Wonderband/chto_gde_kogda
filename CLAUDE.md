# CHGK Game — Claude Code Instructions

## Project Summary
AI-powered "Що? Де? Коли?" home party game app. Breaking Bad Edition.
Breaking Bad characters play TV viewers sending questions.
One team of guests plays against AI "viewers" — first to 6 points wins.
Local app only — runs on host PC, displayed on TV via Chromecast or local IP.

---

## Tech Stack
- React 18 + Vite (plain JSX, NO TypeScript)
- Pure CSS with CSS variables (NO Tailwind, NO MUI, NO UI libraries)
- No backend — all API calls via fetch() directly from browser
- API keys in .env via import.meta.env.VITE_*

---

## AI Services — All OpenAI, Single API Key

### 1. OpenAI Realtime API — gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview (LIVE MODERATOR VOICE)
- This is the PRIMARY moderator voice — replaces TTS for speaking
- WebRTC-based: browser connects directly, no backend needed
- Two short sessions per round:
  - **Pre-question session** (opened during wheel spin via `onTarget` callback, ~4.5s head-start):
    AI announces sector → introduces Breaking Bad character → small talk → reads question → "Время!" → calls `start_timer()` tool → session closes
  - **Post-answer session** (opened in EVALUATING state after STT captures team answer):
    AI repeats answer → builds logic → reveals correct answer → pronounces verdict → announces score → calls `end_round()` tool → session closes
- Voice: `echo` (Realtime API doesn't have "onyx")
- Tool calling: `start_timer()` signals end of question reading; `end_round(correct, who_scores, correct_answer_reveal)` signals evaluation complete
- Model: `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview`
- SDP exchange: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime?model=gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview
- File: `src/services/realtime.js`

### 2. OpenAI Responses API — gpt-4o (MOCK MODE / FALLBACK ONLY)
- Used ONLY when VITE_USE_MOCK=true
- Was original AI moderator before Realtime API migration
- URL: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
- Uses `previous_response_id` for stateful continuity
- File: `src/services/openai.js`

### 3. OpenAI STT — gpt-4o-mini-transcribe (Speech-to-Text)
- Converts team's spoken answer to text transcript
- ALWAYS used (even in real mode) — Realtime session receives transcript as text input
- Model: `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` (NOT whisper-1)
- URL: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions
- Language: "ru" default, supports "uk"
- File: `src/services/transcribe.js`

### 4. OpenAI TTS — tts-1, voice: onyx (Text-to-Speech)
- Used for: LISTENING state announcement ("Стоп!" / "Досрочный ответ!")
- NOT used for main moderator speech (Realtime handles that)
- Model: `tts-1`, voice: `onyx`
- URL: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/speech
- File: `src/services/tts.js`

### 5. Web MediaRecorder API (microphone)
- Records team answer as audio blob → sent to STT
- File: `src/services/recorder.js`

## Game State Machine
```
IDLE → SPINNING → READING → DISCUSSING → LISTENING → EVALUATING → SCORING → READY → (SPINNING or GAME_OVER)
```

**State details (real mode):**
- **SPINNING**: Roulette spins. `onTarget(sector)` fires immediately → opens pre-question Realtime session
- **READING**: Pre-session already speaking (sector → character → question → "Время!"). Session calls `start_timer()` → READING_DONE → DISCUSSING
- **DISCUSSING**: 60s timer (20s for blitz). E=early answer
- **LISTENING**: TTS plays "Стоп!" (onyx). Recording starts. Enter → RECORDING_DONE → EVALUATING
- **EVALUATING**: Post-answer Realtime session opens. Transcript injected. AI evaluates → calls `end_round()` → 2500ms delay → EVALUATION_DONE → SCORING
- **SCORING**: Real mode — no TTS (Realtime already spoke). Immediately SCORING_DONE → score update
- **READY**: Press Space for next round

---

## Blitz Round Logic
- Questions have `round_type: "blitz"`, `blitz_group`, `blitz_position` (1/2/3)
- On SPIN_DONE: all 3 questions from same group loaded; Q1 = currentQuestion, Q2+Q3 = blitzQueue
- Timer = 20s per blitz question
- Correct answer (experts) → next blitz question (no score yet)
- Wrong answer OR final blitz question → score update, clear blitzQueue

## Key Implementation Details

### RealtimeSession (src/services/realtime.js)
```javascript
const session = new RealtimeSession()
session.onToolCall = (name, args) => { /* name: 'start_timer' | 'end_round' */ }
session.onError = (err) => { /* fallback */ }
await session.open({ apiKey, instructions, tools, voice: 'echo', triggerText })
session.close()  // cleanup: stops WebRTC, removes audio element
```
- VAD disabled (`turn_detection: null`) — app controls turns via text
- 40s safety timeout if AI never calls the expected tool
- Instructions built by: `buildPreQuestionInstructions(systemPrompt, ctx)` and `buildPostAnswerInstructions(systemPrompt, ctx)`

### App.jsx key refs
```javascript
preSessionRef   // RealtimeSession — pre-question (opened in handleRouletteTarget)
postSessionRef  // RealtimeSession — post-answer (opened in EVALUATING effect)
systemPromptRef // string — /system-prompt.txt loaded on mount
```

### Score derivation (important!)
`who_scores` is derived from `args.correct` (NOT from AI's who_scores enum):
```javascript
who_scores: args.correct ? 'experts' : 'viewers'
```
This prevents AI reasoning errors where it says correct score verbally but passes wrong enum.

### sector_number in Realtime instructions
Sector number is embedded directly in ШАГ 1 heading:
`**ШАГ 1 — Объяви сектор ${sector_number}** ... ВАЖНО: произнеси именно число ${sector_number}`
Prevents AI from using wrong number from examples.

---

## Environment Variables (.env)
```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...        # Single key for all OpenAI services
VITE_VECTOR_STORE_ID=vs_...       # From platform.openai.com/storage/vector-stores
VITE_GAME_LANGUAGE=ru             # "ru" or "uk"
VITE_USE_MOCK=false               # "true" to bypass all API calls (mock mode)
```

---

## Keyboard Controls
- Space: Start game / Next round (from READY state)
- E: Early answer (during DISCUSSING)
- P: Pause/Resume timer (during DISCUSSING)
- Enter: Stop recording (during LISTENING)
- R: Restart (from GAME_OVER)

---

## Git Workflow
- Repo: https://github.com/Wonderband/chto_gde_kogda
- Branch: main
- Commit per task/bugfix — test before committing
- Never commit .env (it's in .gitignore)

---

## Important Rules
- Do NOT use Assistants API (deprecated Aug 2025)
- Do NOT use whisper-1 — use gpt-4o-mini-transcribe
- Do NOT use Chat Completions — use Responses API (mock mode) or Realtime API (live)
- Do NOT use TypeScript — plain JSX only
- Do NOT add UI libraries — pure CSS only
- Do NOT add backend — browser fetch() only

---

## Current State (update after each session)

### ✅ Working
- Roulette SVG with 13 sectors, envelope animation, arrow spin physics
- Game state machine (all states + blitz logic)
- Scoreboard, Timer (60s/20s), QuestionCard (hideText during READING)
- Blitz queue: 3 questions loaded at SPIN_DONE, intermediate scoring skipped
- Realtime API pre-question session (WebRTC, SDP exchange, tool calling)
- Realtime API post-answer session (evaluation ritual + end_round tool)
- TTS for LISTENING announcement ("Стоп!" / "Досрочный ответ!")
- STT via gpt-4o-mini-transcribe
- Mock mode (VITE_USE_MOCK=true) fully functional for UI testing
- Git initialized, pushed to GitHub

### 🐛 Known Issues (bugs found in testing, fixes deployed — needs re-testing)
1. **Sector number** — AI was announcing wrong sector. Fix: sector number embedded in ШАГ 1 heading
2. **Phrases cut off** — audio cut before "Время!" finished. Fix: 800ms delay before closePreSession, 2500ms before closePostSession
3. **Double "Стоп!" voice** — TTS + Realtime both said "Стоп!". Fix: removed ШАГ 1 from post-answer instructions
4. **Wrong score display** — AI said 1:1 but screen showed 0:2. Fix: who_scores derived from args.correct

### 📋 Next Tasks (to discuss and plan)
- Re-test all 4 fixes above after git commit
- Revisit overall architecture — user wants to review and possibly simplify
- Update TDD to match current implementation
- Consider whether Realtime API approach is correct or needs redesign
